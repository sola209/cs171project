Our project is entitled "The Invisible Crime: An interactive exploration into the world of human trafficking," and involves a series of interactive visualizations pertaining to the global crisis of human trafficking.

Our website is published at <strong>sola209.github.io/cs171project</strong>

Our screencast is available at <strong>sola209.github.io/cs171project/screencast.html</strong>

Our process book is available at <strong>sola209.github.io/cs171project/blog.html</strong>

The folders and files contained within this repository fall under broad categories of implementation and HTML templates.

The primary structure of our webpage is found in <strong>index.html</strong>.
The <js> folder contains the javascript files that support our 5 primary visualizations:
* A bubble chart outlining the basic forms of human trafficking
* A flow chart displaying trafficking flows for five countries of interest
* A chord diagram and associated data pane displaying regional trafficking flow data
* An interactive slider that displays countries that support a proportion of its trafficked population to exit slavery
* A globe that cycles through stories of trafficking victims

The <strong>img, css, and fonts</strong> folders contain supporting visual elements for our site.

Finally, the <strong>data</strong> folder contains the data sources from which these visualizations were generated.
